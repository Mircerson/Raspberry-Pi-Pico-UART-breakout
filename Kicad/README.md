# Raspberry Pi Pico UART breakout
 A simple 2-layer PCB making the Raspberry Pi Pico a 6 way UART adapter.
 The main purpouse of this board is to be the programmer for the AERQ project which uses UART 0.
 


# Hardware
The board uses


# Software
To make use of all the 6 UART ports available, use [harrywalsh's](https://github.com/ncarandini/KiCad-RP-Pico) software here.
This will make the Pi Pico into a 6 way UART adapter, all the UART ports are marked on the board.
